# node-mongo demo app
### (demo app for the node-mongo project)

Demo (client) app with CRUD operations setup for testing the [boilerplate template kit(s)](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-esm-kit) generated from the [node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli).

Download the app, change directory (cd) into the root of the demo app and install dependencies:
````
npm install
````
Start the app:
````
npm start
````
View the demo app in the browser at http://localhost:4200. Although the app is built with angular, you don't need to have any knowledge of how to write an angular application. See [node-mongo documentation](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/node-mongo/) for how to use the app with the boilerplate template kits.
